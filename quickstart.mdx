<Tip>

In the cloud version, the data is stored in your S3 and compute resources are managed by us.

</Tip>

<Info>
  **For open-source version** We use pnpm package manager to install our repo in your environment. Get in touch on our Discord server and we will provide you the envkey to deploy.
</Info>

Step 1. Sign up for an iceburst account.


Step 2. Connect your S3 by providing these 3 credentials:

| Key                  | Value               | 
| -------------------- | ------------------- | 
| s3_region            | `us-east-1`         |
| s3_access_key_id     | `access_key_id`     |
| s3_secret_access_key | `secret_access_key` |

Step 3. Set up bucket IAM policy for read and write access.

<Tip>

Your bucket doesn't have to be publicly accessible. Recommended to keep it in private.

</Tip>

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
              "s3:ListBucket",
              "s3:GetObject",
              s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::duckstream",
              "arn:aws:s3:::duckstream/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

You're all set!
